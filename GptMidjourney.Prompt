<!-- PREMIERE PARTIE DU PROMPT -->

Introduction : Today we are going to create images using a stable diffusion model called Midjourney. Here is all the information you need to know about it.

1 - A short description of Midjourney

Midjourney is a generative artificial intelligence program and service created and hosted by a San Francisco-based independent research lab Midjourney, Inc. Midjourney generates images from natural language descriptions, called "prompts", similar to OpenAI's DALL-E and Stable Diffusion.


2 - A descriptive message from Midjourney about V5 model

Hi @everyone we’re going to try alpha-testing a version of our V5 algorithms today

To turn it on type --v 5 after your prompt or select "V5" from /settings

What's new with the V5 base model?
- Much wider stylistic range and more responsive to prompting
- Much higher image quality (2x resolution increase) improved dynamic range
- More detailed images. Details more likely to be correct. Less unwanted text.
- Improved performance with image prompting
- Supports --tile argument for seamless tiling (experimental)
- Supports --ar aspect ratios greater than 2:1 (experimental)
- Supports --iw for weighing image prompts versus text prompts

Style and prompting for V5
- Today’s test is basically a ‘pro’ mode of the model. 
- It’s MUCH more ‘unopinionated’ than v3 and v4, and is tuned to provide a wide diversity of outputs and to be very responsive to your inputs.
- The tradeoff here is that it may be harder to use. Short prompts may not work as well. You should try to write longer, more explicit text about what you want (ie: “cinematic photo with dramatic lighting”)
- Please chat with each other in ⁠prompt-chat to figure out how to use v5.
- We hope to have a ‘friendly’ default styling for v5 before we switch it to default. When this happens we will still let you turn it off and get back to something like this ‘raw’ mode today.

Please note
- This is an alpha test and things will change. DO NOT rely on this exact model being available in the future. It will be significantly modified as we take V5 to full release. 
- Right now there is no V5 upsampler, the default resolution of V5 is the same as upscaled V4. If you click upscale it will just instantly give you that one image by itself.

Community Standards:
- This model can generate much more realistic imagery than anything we've released before. 
- We’ve increased the number of moderators, improved moderation tooling, and will be enforcing our community standards with increased strictness and rigor. Don't be a jerk or create images to cause drama.

More about V5:
V5 is our second model trained on our AI supercluster and has been in the works for 5 months. It uses significantly different neural architectures and new aesthetic techniques. V5 isn't the final step, but we hope you all feel the progression of something deep and unfathomable in the power of our collective human imagination.


3 - A descriptive message from Midjourney about V5.1 model

Hey @everyone we've got a few announcements tonight:

We're testing a version 5.1 image system
- V5.1 is more opinionated (like V4) and is MUCH easier to use with short prompts 
- There is a 'unopinionated' mode for V5.1 (similar to V5.0 default) called "RAW Mode"
- Don't worry V5 is still available (as before)

Other changes in V5.1 vs V5.0
- Higher coherence
- More accuracy to text prompts
- Fewer unwanted borders or text artifacts
- Improved sharpness 

How to enable V5.1:
- Go to /settings and click "V5.1" (on the second row) or type--v 5.1 after your prompt 
- For RAW mode click the RAW Mode button under /settings (after clicking V5.1) or type --style raw


4 - Some recommandation from Midjourney documentation for generating prompts

A Prompt is a short text phrase that the Midjourney Bot interprets to produce an image. The Midjourney Bot breaks down the words and phrases in a prompt into smaller pieces, called tokens, that can be compared to its training data and then used to generate an image. A well-crafted prompt can help make unique and exciting images.
Prompt Length
Prompts can be very simple. Single words (or even an emoji!) will produce an image. Very short prompts will rely heavily on Midjourney’s default style, so a more descriptive prompt is better for a unique look. However, super-long prompts aren’t always better. Concentrate on the main concepts you want to create.

Grammar
The Midjourney Bot does not understand grammar, sentence structure, or words like humans. Word choice also matters. More specific synonyms work better in many circumstances. Instead of big, try gigantic, enormous, or immense. Remove words when possible. Fewer words mean each word has a more powerful influence. Use commas, brackets, and hyphens to help organize your thoughts, but know the Midjourney Bot will not reliably interpret them. The Midjourney Bot does not consider capitalization.

Focus on What you Want
It is better to describe what you want instead of what you don’t want. If you ask for a party with “no cake,” your image will probably include a cake. If you want to ensure an object is not in the final image, try advance prompting using the --no parameter.

Think About What Details Matter
Anything left unsaid may suprise you. Be as specific or vague as you want, but anything you leave out will be randomized. Being vague is a great way to get variety, but you may not get the specific details you want.

Try to be clear about any context or details that are important to you. Think about:

Subject: person, animal, character, location, object, etc.
Medium: photo, painting, illustration, sculpture, doodle, tapestry, etc.
Environment: indoors, outdoors, on the moon, in Narnia, underwater, the Emerald City, etc.
Lighting: soft, ambient, overcast, neon, studio lights, etc
Color: vibrant, muted, bright, monochromatic, colorful, black and white, pastel, etc.
Mood: Sedate, calm, raucous, energetic, etc.
Composition: Portrait, headshot, closeup, birds-eye view, etc.

Use Collective Nouns
Plural words leave a lot to chance. Try specific numbers. "Three cats" is more specific than "cats." Collective nouns also work, “flock of birds” instead of "birds.”


5 - List of existing parameters for prompts

Aspect Ratios
--aspect, or --ar Change the aspect ratio of a generation.

Chaos
--chaos <number 0–100> Change how varied the results will be. Higher values produce more unusual and unexpected generations.

No
--no Negative prompting, --no plants would try to remove plants from the image.

Quality
--quality <.25, .5, 1, or 2>, or --q <.25, .5, 1, or 2> How much rendering quality time you want to spend. The default value is 1. Higher values cost more and lower values cost less.

Repeat
--repeat <1–40>, or --r <1–40> Create multiple Jobs from a single prompt. --repeat is useful for quickly rerunning a job multiple times.

Seed
--seed <integer between 0–4294967295> The Midjourney bot uses a seed number to create a field of visual noise, like television static, as a starting point to generate the initial image grids. Seed numbers are generated randomly for each image but can be specified with the --seed or --sameseed parameter. Using the same seed number and prompt will produce similar ending images.

Stop
--stop <integer between 10–100> Use the --stop parameter to finish a Job partway through the process. Stopping a Job at an earlier percentage can create blurrier, less detailed results.

Style
--style <4a, 4b, or 4c> Switch between versions of the Midjourney Model Version 4
--style <cute, expressive, or scenic> Switch between versions of the Niji Model Version 5

Stylize
--stylize <number>, or --s <number> parameter influences how strongly Midjourney's default aesthetic style is applied to Jobs.

tile
--tile parameter generates images that can be used as repeating tiles to create seamless patterns.

Uplight
--uplight Use an alternative "light" upscaler when selecting the U buttons. The results are closer to the original grid image. The upscaled image is less detailed and smoother.

Upbeta
--upbeta Use an alternative beta upscaler when selecting the U buttons. The results are closer to the original grid image. The upscaled image has significantly fewer added details.

Niji
--niji An alternative model focused on anime style images.

High Definition
--hd Use an early alternative Model that produces larger, less consistent images. This algorithm may be suitable for abstract and landscape images.

Test
--test Use the Midjourney special test model.

Testp
--testp Use the Midjourney special photography-focused test model.

Version
--version <1, 2, 3, 4, or 5> or --v <1, 2, 3, 4, or 5> Use a different version of the Midjourney algorithm. The current algorithm (V4) is the default setting.

Uplight
--uplight Use an alternative "light" upscaler when selecting the U buttons. The results are closer to the original grid image. The upscaled image is less detailed and smoother.

Upbeta
--upbeta Use an alternative beta upscaler when selecting the U buttons. The results are closer to the original grid image. The upscaled image has significantly fewer added details.

Creative
--creative Modify the test and testp models to be more varied and creative.

Image Weight
--iw Sets image prompt weight relative to text weight. The default value is --iw 0.25.

Sameseed
--sameseed Seed values create a single large random noise field applied across all images in the initial grid. When --sameseed is specified, all images in the initial grid use the same starting noise and will produce very similar generated images.

Video
--video Saves a progress video of the initial image grid being generated. Emoji react to the completed image grid with ✉️ to trigger the video being sent to your direct messages. --video does not work when upscaling an image.


At this point have you understand everything ? Just answer yes and I will provide some more information then.
